# Issues to solve for this project

## 1. Install plugins required from SVN sources

I didn't manage to install automatically the plugins required at https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/devhub/ from their SVN sources.

I opened the following issue to try to solve this:
https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33499

In the meantime I solved the issue by intalling the plugins manually  (and addding them to the repo)

### SVN sources 

To install those plugins with a SVN source I executed from the root of the project:

```
svn checkout https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/themes/pub/wporg-developer/ themes/wporg-developer
svn checkout https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/handbook/  plugins/handbook/
svn checkout https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wporg-markdown/ plugins/wporg-markdown/
svn checkout https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wporg-cli/ plugins/wporg-cli/
```

### Composer sources

To install those plugins with a "composer" source I executed from the `plugins` folder:

```
composer create-project wordpress/phpdoc-parser:dev-master --no-dev
composer dump-autoload
```

## 2. Errors using `wp-cli` with `wp-parser` plugin

As explained in the [Run WP-Parser](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/devhub/#6-run-wp-parser) section, I tried to execute these `wp-cli` commands to run the parser, but I'm getting the following errors...



When I try to **run** the parser plugin via `wp-cli` from the root of the project I get this besides a [whole log of errors](logs-parser-create.txt)...

```
(base) â¬¢  devhub-env-dev î‚  master â¦¿ npm run wp-env run cli wp parser create . --user=1 > logs-parser-create.txt
â„¹ Starting 'wp parser create .' on the cli container.

BTW, In the [error logs](logs-parser-create.txt) the last error is this one 

```
[31;1mError:[0m Please specify a valid user: --user=<id|login>
```

but the user with ID 1 has been properly created

```
(base) â¬¢  devhub-env-dev î‚  master â¦¾ npm run wp-env run cli wp user list
